# Java_RPG_Game
Hello guys!

I recently created a text-based RPG game in the IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE for my school project.

The text-based RPG game contains these functionalities:

* Choosing the names and characters for two players
* Choosing the type of attack/defense that the players can make
* Displaying the remaining HP for each player in every round
* 3 levels in order to determine the winner
* Hide the attack choice automatically for the defense player

Download the ZIP file from the RELEASES section, open the project in your IDE, and enjoy!
