This folder contains all the JAVA files I used to create the project, Version 1.0.
You can download the java files and copy the content, paste them in your new project if you aren't using IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE.
If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, please download the ZIP file in the 'Releases' section, unzip it, and open it in the IDE!
